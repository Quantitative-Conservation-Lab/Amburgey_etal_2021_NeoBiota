## VIS lure/no lure

### Data was collected in 2015 where biologists walked transects in CP that either had traps with mice (lure) or no traps (no lure)
### The goal is to understand if detection probability is different between these two scenarios
### In the case of an incipient or suppressed (low density) population, any way that can maximize detection probability of brown treesnakes can be a useful resource for surveyors
